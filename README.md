The best dashboard for Kubernetes

![Teaser](docs/assets/teaser.jpg)

Kubernetes-dashboard is painful to use and lacks funcionality. To make
kubernetes understandable for a new user it must be viewed as a guitar
pedalboard, except that it is huge and can contain thousands interconnected
entities. In this case it can be visualized as a city map, where pod is a
bulding, deployment is a street and namespace is a district.
